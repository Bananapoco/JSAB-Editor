        "explanation": "A cosmic cat boss level set in deep space. The boss attacks with sweeping paw slashes (wide rects that appear from screen edges), spikeball projectiles (spinning polygons), scratch patterns (rapid diagonal lines), and screen-shaking stomp moments. The pink-on-dark-purple palette evokes a neon nebula, while stars and planet obstacles reinforce the space theme. Rhythm varies from sparse whole-note star pulses in the intro, builds with 8th-note scratch bursts, then peaks at dense quarter-note multi-spawns during the chorus drop."
